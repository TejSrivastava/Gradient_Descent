# Gradient_Descent
Gradient Descent is a form of mathematcial optimization.It's goal is to find optimal parameters that minimize loss.
We do it by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to our parameter using concepts of calculus.
This algorithm is used in some of the popular Machine Learning libraries like Tensorflow, Pytorch and scikit-Learn.
